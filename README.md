# 4-bit MIPS processor
This is a sample project to demonstrate an 4-bit MIPS processor.

### Prerequisite
This project has been developed on LOGISIM v2.7.1 which can be downloaded from `http://www.cburch.com/logisim/`.

### Using the design files
* Run LOGISM and use the `File` menu to open the `CU_v2_3.circ` file in the `v2.3` folder.
* Right click on the `Ins. Memory` module and select `load Image`.
* From the `v2.3/Examples/` folder select any one of the `*_Ins` files to open.
* Similarly load the `*_Dat` file if required.
* From the `Simulate` menu chose a tick frequency.
* From the `Simulate` menu select `Ticks Enabled` option to run the simulation.
